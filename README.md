# gitScrub

## About
This is a formatted readme, it will look for ```##``` headers and parse them into objects to be added to a json array. In this case, this section should be added to about. Now I'm just rambling on to fill the about section.

## Dates
July 2015 - Present
  
## Links
http://www.github.com/vishalkuo.gitScrub

## Technologies
* nodeJS
* Gitup API
* RSVPromise
* Restler

## Notes
Hopefully gitScrub will be smart enough to create an array of objects if bullet points are present, else it'll present everything as a single string object. Obviously very much so a WIP so fork and PR away! At this point I'm just adding sections to fill the readme so I have something to test so don't mind me!
